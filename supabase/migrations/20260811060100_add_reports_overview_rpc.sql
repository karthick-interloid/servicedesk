-- Add public.reports_overview() — the Reports screen aggregate RPC
-- Mirrors supabase/schemas/functions/08_reports_overview.sql exactly.

-- SECURITY INVOKER (the default, stated explicitly because it is the whole security
-- design). The function runs as the CALLER, so `tickets_select`, `sla_events` and
-- `memberships_select` are what scope every row it reads. There is deliberately NO
-- `tenant_id = current_tenant_id()` anywhere below: a filter here would read as the
-- boundary while RLS quietly did the real work, and the two would drift. Same rule
-- `features/tickets/services/ticket.service.ts` states for its queries.
--
-- Why an RPC rather than client-side reduction: the medians are `percentile_cont`, which
-- has no client equivalent that isn't "fetch every ticket and sort in JavaScript". The
-- weekly series additionally needs a generated week spine so empty weeks still render a
-- bar. Both are cheap in Postgres and neither is expressible in PostgREST filters.
--
-- Two things the design draws are NOT here, and cannot be:
--   · CSAT — no satisfaction/rating table exists anywhere in the schema.
--   · business-hours-aware durations — every duration below is WALL CLOCK. Honouring
--     `business_hours.schedule_json` is a real calculation, not a swap. Deferred; the UI
--     says so rather than presenting wall-clock as business-hours.
