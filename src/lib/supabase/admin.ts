/**
 * Service-role Supabase client. BYPASSES ROW LEVEL SECURITY ENTIRELY.
 *
 * Everything in supabase/schemas/policies/ is inert for this client: it is not the
 * `authenticated` role, `auth.uid()` is null, and no policy is consulted. Treat every query
 * written against it as if the tenant boundary does not exist, because it doesn't.
 *
 * ONLY use it where RLS makes the operation impossible by construction. Today that is
 * exactly one place: provisioning a brand-new organization. The INSERT policies on
 * `tenants`, `subscriptions`, `business_hours` and `sla_policies` all require a
 * `tenant_role` claim, and the hook that stamps that claim reads `memberships` — which
 * doesn't have a row yet at signup. Nothing can satisfy them on the first write, so the
 * chicken-and-egg is broken here instead.
 *
 * For everything else use `@/lib/supabase/server`, which runs as the caller with RLS on.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` has no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix precisely so Next
 * cannot inline it into a client bundle. Never import this from a "use client" module.
